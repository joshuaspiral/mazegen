# Maze Generator
A maze generator written in C++. Uses the recursive backtracker algorithm.

# Dependencies
[raylib](raylib.com)  
On Arch Linux, it is as simple as `pacman -S raylib`

# Build instructions

```
$ make
$ ./mazegen
```
 
# Details
As always, I make a few implementations of the same program. Here is a grid version, that stores the maze in an array, and the lines version which only draws the maze.
